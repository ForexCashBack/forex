                <b>Your spreads and trading conditions <em>DO NOT</em> change</b>, they remain the same as if you had opened an account directly with the broker.

            <p>
                How can we pay you for each trade you place without somehow adversely affecting trading conditions?<br>
                The answer is simple.
            </p>
            <p>
                We are paid a commission from the marketing budget of the <a href="{{ path('broker_list') }}" class="highlight">brokerage firms we represent</a> for each trade placed by a client we introduce to them, or who otherwise engages us as their '<em>Introducing Broker</em>'.<br>
                We in turn keep only a portion of the commission and pass much of it onto our client.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our clients get the <b>same spreads and conditions</b> as if they had opened an account directly with the broker, the only difference is a client that goes through us gets a cash commission for every trade placed on their account.<br>
                Our service is an effective broker marketing tool. The brokers we represent are happy to pay us a volume based commission for the opportunity to appear on our website and gain clients.
            </p>
