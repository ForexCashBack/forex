    <h3>How does this work?</h3>
    <p class="hero-unit" style="padding: 5px; border: 1px solid #ccc;">
        When you open a trading account through us we earn a commission from your broker for each trade you place.
        From this commission we in turn <span class="text-success" style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bolder;">pay you cash</span> for each trade you place.
        Your spreads and trading conditions <b>DO NOT</b> change, they remain the same as if you had opened an account directly with the broker.
        Please read further on below for more details about our company and service.

            <h3>What we do</h3>
            <p>
                Our service pays you cash for each trade you place at many industry leading currency trading brokers.
                The spreads and trading conditions at the brokers we represent are never adversely affected by opening an account through us.
                This would be counterintuitive to a trader's best interest and thus, our business model.
                Cash rebates are paid on a monthly basis and can amount to very substantial savings, always increasing a trader's bottom line and often even making the difference between profit and loss.
                Our friendly and knowledgeable support staff is available to assist with questions or problems most hours of the day via live chat, telephone, and email.

            <h3>How it works</h3>
            <p>
                You may be wondering, how can we pay you for each trade you place without somehow adversely affecting trading conditions?
                It is a great question, and the answer is simple.
                We are paid a commission from the marketing budget of the brokerage firms we represent for each trade placed by a client we introduce to them, or who otherwise engages us as their 'introducing broker'.
                We in turn keep only a portion of the commission and pass much of it onto our client.
                Our clients get the same spreads and conditions as if they had opened an account directly with the broker, the only difference is a client that goes through us gets a cash commission for every trade placed on their account.
                Our service is one of the most effective broker marketing tools on the entire web, so the brokers we represent are happy to pay us a volume based commission for the opportunity to appear on our website and gain clients.

            <h3>How much will I earn?</h3>
            <p>
                Some traders earn many thousands of dollars per month, some earn far less.
                Your earnings will depend on 3 things:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>The rebate rate at the broker you choose</li>
                <li>The pairs you trade</li>
                <li>The volume you trade on each pair</li>
            </ol>

            <p class="muted">To estimate or calculate your rebates, please see our cashback estimator in the sidebar.</p>

        <div class="span4">
            <h3>When and how will I receive my payment?</h3>
            <p>
                Rebates are paid on a monthly basis no later than the 25th of the month following the month commissions were earned in.
                The actual payment date varies based on the broker(s) and payment method you choose, please see the payments faq for more detailed information.
